# MemoryMS-Client
**Get the client to play MemoryMS!**

## Steps:
- Download the zipped client from the latest releases
- Create a new folder where you'd like to keep your game
- (Skip if already done) Set an exclusion on Windows Defender or your antivirus software for that new folder
- Extract the client and its directories into that new folder (you can try deleting the older version files first to make sure there's no mistakes)
- Click on MemoryMS.exe

## Known issues:
- We know about issues regarding when the client is launched and there's no launch
- There's also an issue with the coinitialize error
All of these issues are usually solved after trying to launch the client again multiple times.
